👋 Hi, I’m Antonio (@Robotsyt)
👀 I’m interested in Python, C#, Flask, JavaScript, and gaming.
🌱 I’m currently learning through the Backend roadmap — building multiple projects as I go to test and strengthen my skills.
🛠️ Currently working on an Intermediate Python Equipment Check-Out System — a project to manage and track gear usage using backend logic.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects — open to learning and building together.
📫 Reach me preferably through GitHub.
⚡ After I drink coffee, I show my empty mug to the IT guy and tell him I’ve successfully installed Java. ☕
